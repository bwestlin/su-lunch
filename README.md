# su-lunch #
> Dagens luncher - Stockholms Universitet

This is a simplistic web-application used for aggregating lunch menus in the area around Stockholm University and it's currently alive at **http://su-lunch.herokuapp.com/**.

The application is built using **[Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com)** and written mainly in **[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)**.
Data collecting is done with **[Web scraping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)** using the **[jsoup](http://jsoup.org/)** HTML Parser.

## Running ##
The easiest way to run this application is with the following command in the project directory:
```
./activator run
```
After this the application can be accessed from a web browser at **http://localhost:9000/** however it might take some time initially for the dependencys to resolve.

## IDE setup for **[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)**##
Either import the project as an SBT project in IDEA

or

issue the following command in the project directory:
```
./activator idea
```
This creates an IntelliJ project which can be opened from IntelliJ as a regular project.

To run the application during development and make it recompile directly on source-code changes start it with the following command:
```
./activator ~run
```
